			<h1>What are oil spills?</h1>
			<p>Oil spills are a form of pollution that occur when through human activity,
				an accident occurs and the oil is released into the surrounding waters</p>
			<h1>When do they happen?</h1>
			<p>It occurs due to human activity such as making a mistake or being careless and
				is sometimes deliberately dumped illegally, it can also occur because of equipment
				breaking down and very rarely, natural disasters like hurricanes.</p>

			<h1>So? Why are oil spills bad?</h1>
			<p>Severe damage to the ocean ecosystem in several ways:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Oil drilling and production release pollution into the water on a daily basis:<br>
					A single production platform can discharge over 90,000 tonnes of toxic waste into the ocean on average
					during its lifetime.</li><br>
				<ul>
					<li>Since 1997, the Newfoundland and Labrador Offshore Petroleum Board recorded 337 oil spills
					from three rigs, dumping an estimated 430,000 litres of synthetic drilling fluids and hydrocarbons
					into the ocean.</li><br>
				</ul>
				<li>After a major spill, shorelines can remain polluted for decades; even now, 20 years after Exxon Valdez spilled its oil,
					raw crude oil can still be found in the beaches.</li><br>
				<li>Significant damage and harm towards species in the ecosystem:</li>
				<ul><br>
					<li>Oil and the chemicals it is made up of are poisonous, causing danger to animals that
						ingest it.</li><br>
					<li>It can also smother small animals, blocking respiratory systems.</li><br>
					<li>Sea otters and birds if coated in oil can affect their ability to maintain body temperature
						and may even die of hypothermia.</li><br>
					<li>Study on bottlenose dolphins showed a link between contaminated areas and higher mortalities
						as well as disease conditions.</li>

			<h1>Real Life Example: The Infamous BP Oil Spill of 2010</h1>
			<ul>
				<li>On April 20, 2010, in the Gulf of Mexico, near Southern United States, an oil rig called
					<i>Deepwater Horizon</i> exploded, killing 11 people and releasing around 35,000 - 60,000
					barrels of oil per day.</li><br>
				<li>Was not fixed until the spill was plugged on July 15, 2010, release 4 million barrels</li><br>
				<li>Plants & animals in the ecosystem were covered in the oil, and soon after
				seabirds, turtles, fish and dolphins were found dead, causing massive damage to the ecosystem.</li><br>
				<li>Fishing was banned and tourism declined as a result</li><br>
				<li>BP was fined $18.7 billion in damage soon after.</li>

			<h1>What can be done to fix oil spills?</h1>
			<p>While it cannot be entirely avoided due to the fact that oil spills are generally a byproduct of
				accidents, measures can be taken to minimize the risk of an oil spill as well as to mitigate its
				impact and clean it up.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>To minimize the chances of oil spills occurring, stricter regulations can be enforced
					such as more routine inspections and maintenance of equipment.</li><br>
				<li>Reinforcing vessels like oil tankers with a double hull to reduce risk and severity of a spill</li><br>
				<li>To clean up oil spills one can use skimmer machines to remove oil from the water
					though various methods</li><br>
				<li>Oil dispersant (like Corexit 9527) can be used, although with side effects such as high toxicity</li><br>

			<h1>What can be done to fix oil spills? (cont.)</h1>
			<ul>
				<li>Herding agents can be used to cause the oil to 'clump' together, making larger slicks that can be collected</li><br>
				<li>Some organisms have been discovered with the ability to break down oil, like the bacteria <i>Alcanivorax borkumensis</i></li><br>
				<li>Oil spills can be monitored through a satellite called synthetic aperture radar (SAR)</li><br>
				<li>Oil spills can be also be monitored as morning oils absorb light and release
					thermal energy, allowing detection through remote sensing.</li>
